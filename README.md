# Capstone-Project (Oct 2022 â€“ May 2023)

Analyzed raw data to determine important pre-processing steps on over 45 million data points before data analytics.

Applied machine learning tools to determine relevant Cainiao network actions that influenced customer satisfaction.

Developed key metrics to help understand why and how customers reacted to different shipping situations.

Implemented different Machine learning algorithms like Random forest, Bagging, boosting and time series forecasting. 

Used smote to address imbalance in data and Proposed Algorithm with 72% accuracy to predict customer behavior

Predicted replenishment quantity using time series forecasting and formulate inventory allocation strategies

Further researching on estimating purchase likelihood of products, defining pricing strategies and evaluating predictive power on future demand of products



Project Objective :
The goal of our project is to use machine learning to explore which factors affect customer satisfaction and identify customer shopping trends from large datasets. By analyzing this data using machine learning and statistics, we can find out which features in the dataset offer more predictive power on the review score from the customer on each delivery. Additionally we can understand the general shopping preference of customers so that we could provide some insights to improve the shipping process.

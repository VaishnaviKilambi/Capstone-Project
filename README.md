# Capstone-Project (Oct 2022 â€“ May 2023)
Analyzed data for Chinese logistics firm and Identified key factors that impact customer review scores

Proposed algorithm with 72% accuracy after implementing different machine learning algorithms like Logistic regression, Boosting, Decision trees and Random Forest

Further researching on estimating purchase likelihood of products, defining pricing strategies and evaluating predictive power on future demand of products

Predicted replenishment quantity using time series forecasting and formulate inventory allocation strategies


Project Objective :
The goal of our project is to use machine learning to explore which factors affect customer satisfaction and identify customer shopping trends from large datasets. By analyzing this data using machine learning and statistics, we can find out which features in the dataset offer more predictive power on the review score from the customer on each delivery. Additionally we can understand the general shopping preference of customers so that we could provide some insights to improve the shipping process.
